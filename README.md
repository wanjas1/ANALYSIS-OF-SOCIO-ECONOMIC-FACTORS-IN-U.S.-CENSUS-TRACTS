ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS IN U.S. CENSUS TRACTS

This study leverages the 2017 American Community Survey Census Tract Data to unveil critical insights into the socio-economic and demographic dynamics across the United States. By employing a comprehensive analytical approach, including statistical analysis and geographic mapping in Tableau, I dissected various socio-economic indicators such as income levels, poverty rates, employment patterns, housing characteristics, and racial and ethnic diversity across different census tracts. 

The methodology involved an in-depth examination of disparities in economic and demographic factors, correlating these with housing and living conditions, and analyzing commuting patterns to infer their impact on local employment sectors. 

Key findings highlight significant regional disparities in income and poverty, the influence of racial and ethnic composition on socio-economic status, and notable correlations between commuting habits and employment types. 

The significance of this study lies in its potential to inform policymaking and contribute to targeted socio-economic interventions. By mapping these trends and patterns, we offer a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between demographic factors and socio-economic conditions across U.S. communities.
