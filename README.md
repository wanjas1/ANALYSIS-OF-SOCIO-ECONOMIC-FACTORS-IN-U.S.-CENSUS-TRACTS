ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS IN U.S. CENSUS TRACTS
This study leverages the 2017 American Community Survey Census Tract Data to unveil critical insights into the socio-economic and demographic dynamics across the United States. By employing a comprehensive analytical approach, including statistical analysis and geographic mapping in Tableau, I dissected various socio-economic indicators such as income levels, poverty rates, employment patterns, housing characteristics, and racial and ethnic diversity across different census tracts.
